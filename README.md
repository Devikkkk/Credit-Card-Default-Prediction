# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting **credit card defaults** using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of **financial and demographic variables** related to credit card clients, with the goal of identifying key risk factors that influence default behavior.

## Project Goals
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in credit default cases.
- **Preprocess data** by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing financial attributes.
- **Train multiple machine learning models** to predict default probability.
- **Evaluate model performance** using classification metrics.
